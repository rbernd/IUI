            <h2>Bio</h2>Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Robert and I am in the MLIS program at IU-Indianapolis. I have five years of library experience and enjoy working in an academic environment.
			I previously attained a Bachelors degree in History from Northern Illinois University. While I was not aware at the time, developing skills in how to naviagate and search academic databases would be
			just as important as the content I was learning. With this website I am going to privide some additional information on my personal hobbies and interest.
