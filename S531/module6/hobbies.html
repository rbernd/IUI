            <h2>Board Games</h2><img src="gencon.jpg" alt="My wife and I in front of a Gen Con sign">I collect board games and currently have over 150 games. My wife and I attend Gen Con (a large board game convention in Indianapolis) every year so we can see and demo new games.
			I also enjoy hosting games nights for a small group of close friends. Most of our favorite games are cooperative, where the players are all working together to solve the puzzle or scenario presented by the game.

            <h2>Bowling</h2> Starting in January 2023 I joined my first bowling league and began to bowl competitatively. I have since purchased my own shoes and several bowling balls and are now in my third league. Over the course 
			of the last year I have seen steady improvement in my bowling and are enjoying the conintued challenge to improve. Videos, such as the one included here, have been very helpful in learning and applying different concepts.
