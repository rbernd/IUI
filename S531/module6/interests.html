            <h2>Reading</h2>As with most who seek a career in libraries I love to read and have since a young age. As a child, our local public library was the first place I was allowed to go on my own.
			While I already enjoyed reading, I think my parents knew what they were doing because I immediately took to embracing this newfound responsibility and freedom. I would regularly ride my bike to the library
			to browse the shelves and find a new book. With dreams of being an astronaut I read everything I could find about the Mercury Seven and space travel. Eventually my interest would take me down a different career path, but
			still, some of my favorite things to read are biographies and science fiction.

            <h2>Formula 1</h2>As with many others, I began watching Formula 1 after watching the "Drive to Survive" docuseries on Netflix during the pandemic. It has since become one of my favorite sports.
			Most races happen on Sunday mornings between 8:00am and 9:00am in my time zone, so sipping coffee and watching the race has become a bit of a weekend ritual in our house.

            <h2>Star Wars</h2>As a child of the 90's, my first introduction to Star Wars was in 1997 when the "Special Edition" of the original triliogy was released. My brother, who is nine years older than me, got the VHS set for Christmas.
			I was immediately hooked after my first watch and became a life-long fan. I still enjoy the universe George Lucas created and look forward to any new book, film, show, or game that is released.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>My first experience with video games was watching my older cousins compete to see who could get farthest in Super Mario Bros. Although, without a console at home, video games were resurved as something 
			to do when visiting friends or family. I eventually got a game and console of my own, Pokemon Red for Gameboy, and would spend hours exploring the world behind the tiny, square screen. My favorite game is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
			and I still enjoy the thrill of discovery from exploring the worlds of video game creators.
